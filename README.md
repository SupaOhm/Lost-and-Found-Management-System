## Installation

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4+ or PHP 8+
- MySQL 5.7+
- A web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- MAMP/LAMP/LEMP stack or similar

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone/Extract** the project to your web server root:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SupaOhm/Lost-and-Found-Management-System.git
   cd Lost-Found
   ```

2. **Create Database:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < sql/schema.sql
   mysql -u root -p lost_found_db < sql/config.sql
   mysql -u root -p lost_found_db < sql/scripts.sql
   mysql -u root -p lost_found_db < sql/privileges.sql
   mysql -u root -p lost_found_db < sql/syntheticrecords.sql  # Optional: sample data
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connections:**
   Edit `config/userconfig.php`, `config/adminconfig.php`, and `config/staffconfig.php`:
   ```php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $port = '8889';  // Adjust for your setup (default MySQL: 3306)
   $dbname = 'lost_found_db';
   $user = 'user_user';  // or admin_user, staff_user
   $password = 'user_password';  // Set in privileges.sql
   ```

4. **Set Encryption Key (Optional):**
   Phone numbers are encrypted using AES-256-CBC. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export LF_ENCRYPT_KEY="your_32_character_encryption_key"
   ```
   If not set, a default key is used (not recommended for production).

5. **Access the Application:**
   - User Login: `http://localhost/Lost-Found/`
   - Admin Login: `http://localhost/Lost-Found/pages/admin_login.php`
   - Staff Login: `http://localhost/Lost-Found/pages/staff_login.php`

### Database Users & Privileges
The system uses three separate database users with different privilege levels:
- **user_user** — Limited privileges for regular users (SELECT, INSERT, DELETE on items/claims, UPDATE on User/LostItem/FoundItem)
- **staff_user** — Extended privileges for staff (full access to items and claims)
- **admin_user** — Full privileges for administrators

Passwords are set in `sql/privileges.sql`.

### Default Credentials (Development)
Check `sql/syntheticrecords.sql` for test users created during database initialization.

- **Session Management** — Secure session-based authentication
- **Input Validation** — Server-side validation and sanitization
- **Ownership Checks** — Users can only modify their own reports/claims
- **Privacy-First Contact Sharing** — Contact information only revealed when appropriate (claim approval)
- **Database Privilege Separation** — Different DB users with minimal required privileges

## UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design** — Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Modern Gradient UI** — Gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, shadow effects

- **Contextual Guidance** — Step-by-step instructions based on item type
- **Notification System** — Bell icon with badge counter for real-time updates
- **Pagination** — Clean pagination for large lists of items
- **Accessibility** — Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

- Photo upload feature for items (currently text-only descriptions)
- Email notifications not yet implemented

## Project Status

🔄 **In Active Development** — Features and improvements are being added regularly.

## Recent Updates (Changelog Snapshot)
**Schema:** Introduced separate `admin_approver_id` and `staff_approver_id` columns in `ClaimRequest` replacing polymorphic approver pattern; added trigger `BeforeFoundItemDelete` to automatically remove related `ClaimRequest` rows before a `FoundItem` delete.

**Triggers:**
- `BeforeUserDelete` — Cleans up related claims, found items, lost items.
- `BeforeFoundItemDelete` — Cleans up claims for the specific found item.

**Procedures Added / Revised:**
- `ViewProcessedClaimsWithDetails`, `ViewStaffProcessedClaims` reflect new approver column structure.
- `GetUserClaimNotifications`, `GetFoundItemClaimNotifications` power dashboard bell notifications.
- `ApproveClaim` / `RejectClaim` now route approver IDs into the correct dedicated column.

**Report Filtering:** Admin and Staff report pages now support item type (lost/found) and status (pending/available vs claimed/returned) filters with active filter display and clear button.

**Deletion Logic:** Application layer simplified—claim cleanup for found item deletion now handled by trigger instead of manual PHP deletion cascade.

**Security Note:** Encryption section documents recommendation to migrate to per‑record random IV for phone number storage.

**Consistency:** All view item and claim operations use prepared statements, reducing SQL injection surface.

_Keep this section updated as further changes land._
